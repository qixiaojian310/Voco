Sense of \"destruction, death\" was in Old English. Meaning \"division or quarter of a town\" was in Old English. The end \"the last straw, the limit\" (in a disparaging sense) is from 1929. The end-man in minstrel troupes was one of the two at the ends of the semicircle of performers, who told funny stories and cracked jokes with the middle-man. U.S. football end zone is from 1909 (end for \"side of the field occupied by one team\" is from 1851). The noun phrase end-run is attested from 1893 in U.S. football; extended to military tactics by 1940. End time in reference to the end of the world is from 1917. To end it all \"commit suicide\" is attested by 1911. Be-all and end-all is from Shakespeare (\"Macbeth\" I.vii.5).",

After c. 950, it displaced earlier se (masc.), seo (fem.), þæt (neuter), and probably represents se altered by the th- form which was used in the masculine oblique cases.\nOld English se is from PIE root *so- \"this, that\" (source also of Sanskrit sa, Avestan ha, Greek ho, he \"the,\" Irish and Gaelic so \"this\"). For the þ- forms, see that. The s- forms were superseded in English by mid-13c., with a slightly longer dialectal survival in Kent.\nOld English used 10 different words for \"the,\" but did not distinguish \"the\" from \"that.\" That survived for a time as a definite article before vowels (that one or that other).\nIn adverbial use, in clauses such as the more the merrier, the first the is a different word, a fossil of Old English þy, the instrumentive case of the neuter demonstrative (see that), used with relative force: \"by how much more ____, by so much more ____.\" Of the common phrases, the sooner the better, is by 1771; the less said the better from 1680s.\nIn emphatic use, \"the pre-eminent, par excellence, most approved or desirable,\" by 1824, often italicized.
