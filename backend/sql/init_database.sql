Nuclear winter was coined by U.S. atmospheric scientist Richard Turco but is first attested in article by Carl Sagan in \"Parade\" magazine, Oct. 30, 1983. Nuclear family, originally a sociologists\' term, is first attested 1949 in \"Social Structure,\" by American anthropologist G.P.

That is \n mutual which is freely interchanged: mutual love, affection, hatred. The word is sometimes incorrectly used for \n common: \n our mutual friend, a phrase of very frequent occurrence, no doubt owing to the perfectly correct \'mutual friendship.\' [J.H.A. Günther, \"English Synonyms Explained & Illustrated,\" Groningen, 1904]\n\nMutual Admiration Society (1851) seems to have been coined by Thoreau. Mutual fund is recorded from 1950.\nThe Cold War\'s mutual assured destruction is attested from 1966. Assured destruction was a 1962 term in U.S. military policy circles in reference to nuclear weapons as a deterrent, popularized c. 1964 by Robert McNamara, U.S. Secretary of Defense under Lyndon Johnson, e.g. statement before House Armed Services Committee, Feb. 18, 1965. The notion was \"the minimum threat necessary to assure deterrence: the capability to exterminate not less than one third of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\' (USSR) population in a retaliatory nuclear attack.\" [Martin Folly, \"Historical Dictionary of U.S. Diplomacy During the Cold War\"].\nBy 1964, as the Soviet Union caught up to NATO in ICBMs, the mutual was added, perhaps first by Donald Brennan, conservative defense analyst and a public critic of the policy, who also noted the acronym MAD.)'),(124,'hectare','ˈhekteə(r)','1817, from French hectare \"a hundred ares,\" formed from Latinized form of Greek hekaton \"a hundred\" (see hecatomb) + Latin area \"vacant piece of ground\" (see area).

The Old English word was lean, related to loan and representing the usual Germanic word (Gothic laun, Dutch loon, German Lohn).\nTraditionally in English wages were payment for manual or mechanical labor and somewhat distinguished from salary or fee. Modern French cognate gages (plural) means \"wages of a domestic,\" one of a range of French \"pay\" words distinguished by class, such as traitement (university professor), paye, salaire (workman), solde (soldier), récompense, prix.\nWage-earner \"one who receives stated wages for labor\" is attested from 1871.'),(150,'landscape','ˈlændskeɪp','c. 1600, \"painting representing an extensive view of natural scenery,\" from Dutch landschap \"landscape,\" in art, a secondary sense from Middle Dutch landscap \"region,\" from land \"land\" (see land) + -scap \"-ship, condition\" (see -ship).\nA painters\' term; the non-artistic meaning \"tract of land with its distinguishing characteristics\" is an extended sense from 1886.

A woman especially who knows how to handle other women, and who can make herself beloved by the children who may visit the studio. A woman, also, who in a thoroughly suave and dignified way, knows just how to handle the young man of the period so that the photographer may be glad to have his business. What a power the receptionist is when properly chosen and trained. It is not too much to say that she can both make and destroy a business, if she has the amount of discretionary power given to her in some galleries. [John A.

Sir Thomas Browne uses securement; Francis Bacon and Mrs. Browning have secureness. Surety is a doublet, via French.\nThe meaning \"something which secures, that which makes safe\" is from 1580s. The specific legal sense of \"something pledged as a guarantee of fulfillment of an obligation\" is from mid-15c. (originally a guarantee of good behavior).\nThe meaning \"safety of a state, person, etc.\" is by 1941. By 1965 Security, with the capital, was generic or shorthand for \"security officials; a state\'s security department or ministry.\"\nThe legal sense of \"property in bonds\" is from mid-15c.; that of \"document held by a creditor as evidence of debt or property and proof of right to payment\" is from 1680s. Security-check (n.) is by 1945.

Related: Clipped; clipping.\nMeaning \"to pronounce words in a shortened form\" is from 1520s. The verb has a long association with shady activities, originally especially in reference to cutting or shaving metal from coins (c. 1400), but later extended to swindles from the sense \"to shear sheep,\" hence clip-joint \"place that overcharges outrageously\" (1933, American English, a term from Prohibition).\nTo clip (someone\'s) wings, figuratively, \"put a check on one\'s ambition\" (1590s) is from the method of preventing a captive bird from flying.'),(158,'apace','əˈpeɪs','late 14c. contraction of a pace (early 14c.), literally \"at a pace,\" but usually with a sense of \"at a good pace,\" from a- (1) \"on\" + pace (n.).'),(159,'yield','jiːld','Middle English yelden, \"relinquish involuntarily; submit to another\'s direction or rule; surrender to a foe;\" from Old English gieldan (West Saxon), geldan (Anglian) \"to pay, pay for; reward, render; worship, serve, sacrifice to\" (class III strong verb; past tense geald, past participle golden), from Proto-Germanic *geldan \"pay.\"\nThis is reconstructed to be from PIE *gheldh- \"to pay,\" a root found only in Balto-Slavic and Germanic (and Old Church Slavonic žledo, Lithuanian geliuoti might be Germanic loan-words).\nGermanic cognates include Old Saxon geldan \"to be worth,\" Old Norse gjaldo \"to repay, return,\" Middle Dutch ghelden, Dutch gelden \"to cost, be worth, concern,\" Old High German geltan, German gelten \"to be worth,\" Gothic fra-gildan \"to repay, requite.\"\n\"[T]he only generally surviving senses on the Continent are \'to be worth; to be valid, to concern, apply to,\' which are not represented at all in the English word\" [OED, 1989].\nThe sense development in English comes via use of this word to translate Latin reddere, French rendre.\nThe sense of \"produce, bear, bring forth,\" also \"give in return for labor\" is from c. 1300, later also in reference to capital invested. The intransitive sense of \"give oneself up, submit, surrender (to a foe)\" is from c. 1300, as is the physical sense of \"give way to superior force.\"\nRelated to Middle Low German and Middle Dutch gelt, Dutch geld, German Geld \"money.\" Related: Yielded; yielding. The old past-participle yolden, \"having surrendered, submissive,\" produced Middle English yolden-man \"prisoner of war.\"'),(160,'fair','feə(r)','Old English fæger \"pleasing to the sight (of persons and body features, also of objects, places, etc.); beautiful, handsome, attractive,\" of weather, \"bright, clear, pleasant; not rainy,\" also in late Old English \"morally good,\" from Proto-Germanic *fagraz (source also of Old Saxon fagar, Old Norse fagr, Swedish fager, Old High German fagar \"beautiful,\" Gothic fagrs \"fit\"), perhaps from PIE *pek- (1) \"to make pretty\" (source also of Lithuanian puošiu \"I decorate\").\nThe meaning in reference to weather preserves the oldest sense \"suitable, agreeable\" (opposed to foul (adj.)). Of the main modern senses of the word, that of \"light of complexion or color of hair and eyes, not dusky or sallow\" (of persons) is from c. 1200, faire, contrasted to browne and reflecting tastes in beauty. From early 13c. as \"according with propriety; according with justice,\" hence \"equitable, impartial, just, free from bias\" (mid-14c.).\nOf wind, \"not excessive; favorable for a ship\'s passage,\" from late 14c. Of handwriting from 1690s. From c. 1300 as \"promising good fortune, auspicious.\" Also from c. 1300 as \"above average, considerable, sizable.\" From 1860 as \"comparatively good.\"\nThe sporting senses (fair ball, fair catch, etc.) began to appear in 1856. Fair play is from 1590s but not originally in sports (earlier it meant \"pleasant amusement,\" c. 1300, and foul play was \"sinful amusement\"). Fair-haired in the figurative sense of \"darling, favorite\" is from 1909. First record of fair-weather friends is from 1736 (in a letter from Pope published that year, written in 1730). The fair sex \"women\" is from 1660s, from the \"beautiful\" sense (fair as a noun meaning \"a woman\" is from early 15c.). Fair game \"legitimate target\" is from 1776, from hunting.\n\n Others, who have not gone to such a height of audacious wickedness, have yet considered common prostitutes as fair game, which they might pursue without restraint.
